# ClientBook

ClientBook is an application for insurance agents to manage client contacts, optimized for use with just a keyboard,
but still offering a graphical interface for ease of viewing of client contacts. The purpose of ClientBook is to help 
insurance agents who can type fast to accomplish their client management tasks faster than traditional applications.
If this is the first time that you are using an application like ClientBook, you do not have to worry. We have included
a section [here](#how-to-use-this-user-guide) to guide you through this user guide.

## Why ClientBook?

ClientBook is designed for insurance agents who are always on the go. We understand the pain and inconvenience of having to navigate around
your screen without a mouse while you are out meeting a client. We are also aware that you might have to remember various details about your many clients.

Thus, ClientBook is born!

Requiring **minimal interactions with your cursor**, ClientBook still allows you to complete essential contact management
tasks with our minimal yet essential set of contact management features.


## Purpose of This User Guide

The purpose of this user guide is to help you, the user get started with using ClientBook as well as to help you to get familiarised
with the features that it has to offer so that you can become comfortable with using it in your day-to-day operations as an insurance agent.


## How to Use This User Guide

If you are a new user, you can start with the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section to get ClientBook running. After that,
we have also provided an [Example Usage](#example-usage) section to help you get familiarised with ClientBook.
If you are an experienced user, we have provided a convenient [Summary of Commands](#summary-of-commands) at the end of this user guide.

To familiarise you with the user guide, here are some conventions that are used throughout the user guide.

## Quick Start

The quick start section provides a tutorial which will guide you through the steps needed to get ClientBook running.

<p><b>Step 1.</b></p>

Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
   * To check if you have this installed or for instructions on how to install, refer to our FAQ [here](#frequently-asked-questions).

<p><b>Step 2.</b></p>

Download the latest `clientbook.jar` [here](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/releases).

<p><b>Step 3.</b></p>

Copy the file to the folder (we will be referring to this folder as the **_home folder_**) where you want to store the ClientBook application and your client information.

<p><b>Step 4.</b></p>

Double-click the downloaded `clientbook.jar` file in your home folder to start the app. The screen below should appear in a few seconds. 
   * Alternatively, for those who are tech-savvy, you can launch the application via Command Prompt in Windows or Terminal in Mac OS/Linux using the following command: `java -jar clientbook.jar`. 
   * Note how the app contains some sample data.

        <p align="center"><a href="#glossary">Graphical User Interface</a> of ClientBook.</p>

<div style="page-break-before:always"></div>

<p><b>Step 5.</b></p>

Type a command in the command box and press Enter to execute it.
   * Some example commands you can try:


   | Command | Purpose |
   | ----------- | ----------- |
   | `help` | Opens the help window with a URL to this User Guide |
   | `list` | Lists all contacts |
   | `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/Orchard Street, Block 123, #01-01 i/Policy_1022` | Adds a client named `John Doe` and his information to the ClientBook |
   | `delete 3` | Deletes the 3rd contact in the displayed list (i.e. deletes `Charlotte Oliveiro`) |
   | `exit` | Exits ClientBook |

Please refer to the [Feature-Description](#feature-description) section below for the full list of commands and their descriptions.

## Example Usage

Described below are some commands that you can try to get yourself familiarised with ClientBook.

If you have followed the [Quick Start](#quick-start) guide correctly, you should see the screen below. 
For each of the commands, type them into the command box and press enter to execute the command.

<p align="center"><img src="images/Ui-annotate.png"></p>
<p align="center"><a href="#glossary">Graphical User Interface</a> of ClientBook.</p>
[Return to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-before:always"></div>
<p><b>Step 1.</b></p> 

**Try adding a new Client contact using the command** `add n/James Lee p/91234567 e/james@gmail.com a/Blk 123 Serangoon Rd t/Friend t/Colleague i/OCBC#412>www.ocbc.com/policy/412`.


That is a very long command, but it can be broken down into simple parts. We have just added a client called James Lee with the following details:
* Phone number: 91234567
* Email address: james@gmail.com
* Address: Blk 123 Serangoon Rd

We have also indicated that James is a friend as well as colleague of ours by adding the tags `Friend` and `Colleague`. Lastly,
we indicated that James has purchased a policy from us with a policy ID of OCBC#412 and that the policy's document can be found at `www.ocbc.com/policy/412`.


Now, if you scroll down the contact list, you should find James at the bottom of the list.

<p align="center"><img src="images/newContactJames.png"></p>

<br>

<p><b>Step 2.</b></p>

**Try editing a Client contact using the command `edit 1 p/61234567`.**


This command edits the phone number of the first client displayed in the contact list to 61234567. In this case, Alex Yeoh's
phone number in ClientBook has been changed to 61234567.

<br>

<p><b>Step 3.</b></p>

**Delete a Client contact using the command `delete 3`.**


This command deletes the contact of the third client displayed in the contact list.

### Conclusion
Now that you have tried out the basic commands available in ClientBook, you can use the command `batch delete 1,2,3,4,5,6,7`
to delete all the sample entries and start using your very own ClientBook.

### What information can we store for each client contact?

Each client attribute such as name and address have been assigned identifiers so that you do not have to type out
the entire attribute when using ClientBook. For example, name has been abbreviated to `n`. Listed below are all the identifiers
which correspond to client attributes as well as restrictions that have to be followed when they are used as part of a command.

### <span style="color:#c93640">Contact Viewing Features</span>
Contact viewing features allow you to view your client contacts in different ways. For example,
you may reorder your contact list or look for specific clients.

### <span style="color:#c93640"><code>list</code>: List all clients</span>

**Purpose**: Shows you a list of all your clients. You may use optional identifiers in conjunction with the `-`
symbol to select which client details you want to see, so that you can have a clutter-free view of your client contacts.

**Format**: `list [-p] [-e] [-a] [-i] [-m]`

* A client's name and tags will be shown regardless of the identifiers that you specify.
* You may use one or more optional identifiers.

<br><br>

<div style="page-break-before:always"></div>
### <span style="color:#c93640"><code>find</code>: Search for client contacts based on keywords</span>

**Purpose**: Allows you to find client contacts based on the attribute and keywords that you specify.
You may use optional identifiers in conjunction with the `-` symbol to limit the details shown, similar to the [`list`](#list-list-all-clients) command.

**Format**: `find IDENTIFIER/KEYWORD [& KEYWORDS]…​ [-p] [-e] [-a] [-i] [-m]`

* The `IDENTIFIER` specifies which attribute of the client you want to search for. For example, if you want to search for a client contact
  by name, use the `n` identifier.
    * For more information about the identifiers for each field, refer to [What information can we store for each client contact?](#what-information-can-we-store-for-each-client-contact).
* You may not use multiple attributes as your search criteria.
    * `find n/David a/Botanic gardens` is invalid.
* The search is **case-insensitive**. 
  * `find n/hans` is equivalent to `find n/Hans`.
* The symbol `&` between keywords allows you to search for Clients using multiple keywords.
* The **order of the keywords does not matter**.
  * `find n/alex & david` is equivalent to `find n/david & alex`
    
**Examples**:
* Find all clients whose address contains the word `geylang`.
  * **Command to enter:** `find a/geylang`
    <br><br>
* Find the email and phone number of all clients whose names contain `alex` and `david` using the `&` symbol, and only display their email addresses and phone numbers.
  * `find n/alex & david -e -p`

### <span style="color:#c9a500">Shortcuts</span>
We understand that you might have commands that you frequently use. You may use shortcuts to abbreviate
those commands to make using ClientBook more convenient. As this feature is not commonly found in other contact management applications,
we have included the following Example Usage section to guide you through on how to use this feature. 

### <span style="color:#c9a500">Example Usage</span>
<p><b>Scenario:</b></p> 

You are an insurance agent and you have many client contacts stored inside of ClientBook. Your work mainly requires 
you to manage your clients' policies and you would like a way to view all your clients' policies while hiding other 
additional information (e.g. address, email, phone). You know that you can do so with the `list -i` command. However, 
you would like a faster way to do it because you have to use it frequently, so you decided to create a 
shortcut named `li` to perform the same action as `list -i`.


<p><b>Step 1.</b></p> 

**Adding the shortcut using the command** `addshortcut sn/li sc/list -i`.

This command creates a shortcut which performs `list -i` everytime you type `li` in the command box, and it is saved to 
your shortcut library.


<p><b>Step 2.</b></p> 

**Using the shortcut using the command** `li`.

As you have saved this shortcut in the shortcut library, you may now use `li` to perform the command `list -i` anytime 
and as many times as you want, which will save you from the hassle of having to type `list -i` everytime.
