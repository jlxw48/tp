* This is a **client management application**, which aims to **help insurance agents manage their immense numbers of clients through a desktop application** called _ClientBook_.
* Example usages:
  * Insurance agents can easily manage (_add_, _search_, _edit_, _delete_) their client's contacts in this application.
  * Insurance agents can include their clients' insurance portfolio ID as well as a URL to the document itself in their clients' contact profile.
  * Insurance agents can lock ClientBook to prevent unauthorized access to their clients' information.
* For the detailed documentation of this application, see our **[User Guide](https://ay2021s2-cs2103t-w15-2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html)**.
